# Search Engine
- Tried making a crawler in C language.The task of this crawler is to search websites for links and download the source code of those links.
- Also included a file name crawlerinfo which on startup can be used to initialize the crawler from the point it stopped last time and make sure the work done before is not repeated.
- These source codes are written in files on the same directory as that of crawler.c program starting with 1.txt and then continuing from there.
- Then making an indexer code which will work on the source codes downloaded by the crawler program and will give another file which will store data of different words and links from which they were derived.
- The indexer code is not complete yet.
